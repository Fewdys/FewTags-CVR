Tags/Ranks Mod For Marking Malicious Users/Monkey's, Client Users, Wholesome Users, Devs (Other Then ABI), Avatar/World Creators, Known Crashers, Known Ripper/Reuploaders, CVRMG Members, Friends, & People Who Just Want Whatever They Want To Be Tagged. Includes But Is Not Limited to ABI/CVR Team

##### Keybinds:
- Slash (/) To Reload Tags. (Might Require You To Rejoin World After Pressed - Usually Just Updates After A Few Minutes Though)

#### (Ordered By Priority) To Do List:
- Make Animated Tags
- Make It Possible To See Your Own Tags/Nameplate (Will Do When & If Tag DB Gets Larger)
- Make Some Sort Of Icon Show For Any User Running The Mod (Without The Use Of A Server)

###### *Note: If You Find Someone Who Seems To Be Malicious Or A Ripper/Reuploader In Any Way, Please Inform The ABI/CVR Team First. If ABI Seems To Either Do Nothing About The User Or Is Okay With What The User Is Doing Please Give Me The Persons Username Along With Telling Me What It Is They Were Doing And I Will Try To Look Into It Myself To Determine If They Are Malicious/Monkey/Ripper/Reuploader ect. Another Thing To Note Is If You Want Someone To Be Tagged Something And They Are You're Friend I Have No Problem Tagging Them What You Want As Long As They're Okay With It. Please Keep In Mind Anyone Who Want's A Tag Removed/Changed Can Simply Just Ask For It To Be Removed/Changed As I Have No Problem Doing So.*
